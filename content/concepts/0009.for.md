A for loop is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times. It allows us to perform a set of instructions for each item in a sequence, such as a list or a string.

Here's the basic structure of a for loop:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code to be executed
```

Let's break it down:

- `for` is a keyword that tells Python we want to start a for loop.
- `item` is a variable that represents each item in the sequence. You can choose any name you like for this variable.
- `sequence` is the collection of items over which the loop will iterate. It can be a list, string, tuple, or any other iterable object.
- The colon `:` at the end of the line indicates the start of the loop block.
- The indented code below the `for` statement is the body of the loop. It will be executed for each item in the sequence.

Here's an example that demonstrates how a for loop works:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

In this example, we have a list of fruits. The for loop iterates over each fruit in the list and prints it. The output will be:

```python
apple
banana
orange
```

The loop starts with the first item in the list (`"apple"`), executes the code inside the loop block (printing the fruit), and then moves to the next item (`"banana"`) and repeats the process until all items have been processed.

You can use for loops to perform various operations, such as calculating sums, counting occurrences, or modifying elements in a sequence. The possibilities are endless!

Remember, indentation is crucial in Python. Make sure to indent the code inside the loop block consistently to indicate that it belongs to the loop.
