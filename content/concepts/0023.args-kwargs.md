In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` are special syntaxes used in function definitions to allow for a variable number of arguments.

`*args` is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. The `*` before `args` tells Python to treat any additional arguments passed to the function as a tuple. Here's an example:

```python
def my_function(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

my_function(1, 2, 3)  # Output: 1 2 3
```

In this example, the `my_function` can accept any number of arguments. The `*args` parameter collects all the arguments passed to the function and stores them as a tuple. We can then iterate over the `args` tuple and print each argument.

On the other hand, `**kwargs` is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. The `**` before `kwargs` tells Python to treat any additional keyword arguments passed to the function as a dictionary. Here's an example:

```python
def my_function(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(key, value)

my_function(name="John", age=25)  # Output: name John, age 25
```

In this example, the `my_function` can accept any number of keyword arguments. The `**kwargs` parameter collects all the keyword arguments passed to the function and stores them as a dictionary. We can then iterate over the `kwargs` dictionary and print each key-value pair.

Both `*args` and `**kwargs` provide flexibility when working with functions that need to handle a variable number of arguments. They allow us to write functions that can accept different numbers of arguments without explicitly defining them in the function signature.

It's important to note that `*args` and `**kwargs` are just naming conventions and can be replaced with any valid variable name. The `*` and `**` symbols are what make them special and indicate their purpose.
