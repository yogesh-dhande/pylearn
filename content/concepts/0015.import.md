In Python, import statements are used to bring in external modules or libraries into your code. Modules are pre-written code files that contain functions, classes, and variables that you can use in your program. Importing modules allows us to access their functionality and leverage their capabilities.

To use an import statement, you simply write the import keyword followed by the name of the module you want to import. Here are some examples:

1. Importing the `random` module to generate random numbers:

   ```python
   import random

   print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Output: Random number between 1 and 10
   ```

2. Importing the `datetime` module to work with dates and times:

   ```python
   import datetime

   current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
   print(current_time)  # Output: Current date and time
   ```

3. Importing the `os` module to interact with the operating system:

   ```python
   import os

   print(os.getcwd())  # Output: Current working directory
   ```

4. Importing the `csv` module to read and write CSV files:

   ```python
   import csv

   with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
       reader = csv.reader(file)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)  # Output: Each row of the CSV file
   ```

These examples demonstrate how you can import different modules to access their specific functionality. Remember, there are numerous modules available in the Python standard library and in external libraries that can be imported and used in your code.
