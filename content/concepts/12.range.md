title: The range function
description: The math library is a built-in module that provides various mathematical functions and constants.

The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It is often used in loops to iterate over a specific range of values. Let me explain how it works with an example:

```python
for num in range(5):
    print(num)
```

In this example, we use the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from `0` to `4`. The `range(5)` generates numbers starting from `0` up to, but not including, `5`. The `for` loop then iterates over each number in the sequence and prints it.

The output of this code will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

You can also specify a starting value and an ending value for the range. For example:

```python
for num in range(2, 8):
    print(num)
```

In this code, we use `range(2, 8)` to generate numbers starting from `2` up to, but not including, `8`. The output of this code will be:

```
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

You can also specify a step value to skip numbers in the sequence. For example:

```python
for num in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(num)
```

In this code, we use `range(1, 10, 2)` to generate numbers starting from `1` up to, but not including, `10`, with a step of `2`. The output of this code will be:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

The `range()` function is very useful when you want to repeat a certain action a specific number of times or iterate over a range of values in a loop.
