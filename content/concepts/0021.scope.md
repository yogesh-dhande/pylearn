title: Local and global scope
description: The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed and used within a program.

In Python, variables have different scopes, which determine where they can be accessed and used within a program. The two main scopes are local scope and global scope.

**Local Scope:**

Variables defined inside a function have a local scope. This means they can only be accessed within that specific function. Local variables are created when the function is called and are destroyed when the function completes execution. Here's an example:

```python
def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)

my_function()  # Output: 10
print(x)  # Error: NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

In this example, the variable `x` is defined inside the `my_function()` function. It can only be accessed within the function. If we try to access `x` outside the function, we'll get a `NameError` because `x` is not defined in the global scope.

**Global Scope:**

Variables defined outside any function or at the top level of a module have a global scope. This means they can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions. Global variables are created when they are first assigned a value and exist until the program terminates. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def my_function():
    print(x)

my_function()  # Output: 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

In this example, the variable `x` is defined outside the function, making it a global variable. It can be accessed both inside and outside the function.

**Modifying Global Variables Inside a Function:**

If you want to modify a global variable inside a function, you need to use the `global` keyword to indicate that you want to use the global variable, rather than creating a new local variable. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def my_function():
    global x
    x = 20  # Modifying the global variable
    print(x)

my_function()  # Output: 20
print(x)  # Output: 20
```

In this example, we use the `global` keyword before modifying the value of `x` inside the function. This tells Python that we want to use the global variable `x` rather than creating a new local variable.

It's generally recommended to use global variables sparingly and only when necessary. It's considered good practice to encapsulate variables within functions to avoid potential naming conflicts and improve code maintainability.
