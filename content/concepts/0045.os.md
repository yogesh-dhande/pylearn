The `os` module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows us to perform various operations related to file and directory management, process management, environment variables, and more.

Here are a few practical examples of how you can use the `os` module:

**1. Working with Files and Directories:**

The `os` module provides functions to work with files and directories, such as creating, renaming, deleting, and navigating through them.

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()
print(current_dir)

# Create a new directory
os.mkdir("new_directory")

# Rename a file or directory
os.rename("old_name.txt", "new_name.txt")

# Delete a file or directory
os.remove("file_to_delete.txt")
os.rmdir("directory_to_delete")
```

In this code, we import the `os` module and use its functions to perform various file and directory operations. We get the current working directory using `os.getcwd()`, create a new directory using `os.mkdir()`, rename a file or directory using `os.rename()`, and delete a file or directory using `os.remove()` and `os.rmdir()`.

**2. Running System Commands:**

The `os` module allows us to run system commands using the `os.system()` function.

```python
import os

# Run a system command
os.system("ls -l")
```

In this code, we use the `os.system()` function to run the system command `ls -l`, which lists the files and directories in the current directory.

**3. Environment Variables:**

The `os` module provides functions to access and modify environment variables.

```python
import os

# Get the value of an environment variable
home_dir = os.getenv("HOME")
print(home_dir)

# Set the value of an environment variable
os.environ["MY_VARIABLE"] = "my_value"
```

In this code, we use `os.getenv()` to get the value of the `HOME` environment variable, which stores the path to the user's home directory. We also use `os.environ` to set the value of a custom environment variable called `MY_VARIABLE`.

The `os` module offers many more functions and capabilities for interacting with the operating system. It provides a powerful set of tools to work with files, directories, processes, and environment variables.
