You can create custom exceptions by defining your own exception classes. Custom exceptions allow you to define and raise specific types of errors that are relevant to your program or application.

To create a custom exception, you can define a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class or any of its subclasses. You can add additional attributes or methods to your custom exception class as needed.

Let's take an example of a custom exception called `InvalidInputError`:

```python
class InvalidInputError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Invalid Input: {self.message}"
```

In this code, we define a custom exception class called `InvalidInputError` that inherits from the `Exception` class. We add an `__init__` method to initialize the exception with a custom error message, and a `__str__` method to provide a string representation of the exception when it is raised.

To raise the custom exception, you can use the `raise` keyword followed by an instance of the custom exception class:

```python
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise InvalidInputError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return x / y

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except InvalidInputError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Invalid Input: Cannot divide by zero
```

In this code, we define a function called `divide` that performs division. If the divisor `y` is `0`, we raise the `InvalidInputError` exception with a custom error message. We catch the exception using a `try-except` block and print the error message.
