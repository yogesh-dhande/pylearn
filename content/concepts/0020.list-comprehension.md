List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows us to create a new list by performing operations on existing lists or other iterable objects.

The basic syntax of list comprehension consists of square brackets `[]` enclosing an expression, followed by a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of an iterable object. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
```

In this example, we use list comprehension to create a new list called `squared_numbers`. The expression `x**2` calculates the square of each element `x` in the `numbers` list. The `for` loop iterates over each element in `numbers`, assigning it to the variable `x`.

The resulting `squared_numbers` list will contain the squared values of the original numbers: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.

List comprehension can also include conditional statements to filter the elements that are included in the new list. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
```

In this code, we use list comprehension to create a new list called `even_numbers`. The expression `x` is included in the new list only if the condition `x % 2 == 0` is true. This condition checks if the number is even.

The resulting `even_numbers` list will contain only the even numbers from the original list: `[2, 4]`.

List comprehension is a powerful tool that can make your code more readable and efficient. It can be used to transform, filter, or combine elements from one or more lists.

It's important to note that while list comprehension can be powerful, it's also important to write code that is clear and easy to understand. Sometimes, using a regular `for` loop may be more appropriate, especially for complex operations or when readability is a priority.
