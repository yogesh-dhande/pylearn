The `shutil` module provides a high-level interface for file and directory operations. It offers functions to copy, move, and delete files and directories, as well as other utility functions for working with file paths.

Here are a few practical examples of how you can use the `shutil` module:

**1. Copying Files:**

The `shutil` module provides the `shutil.copy()` function to copy files from one location to another.

```python
import shutil

# Copy a file to a new location
shutil.copy("source_file.txt", "destination_folder/")
```

In this code, we use the `shutil.copy()` function to copy the file `"source_file.txt"` to the `"destination_folder/"`.

**2. Moving Files:**

The `shutil` module provides the `shutil.move()` function to move files or directories to a new location.

```python
import shutil

# Move a file to a new location
shutil.move("source_file.txt", "destination_folder/")
```

In this code, we use the `shutil.move()` function to move the file `"source_file.txt"` to the `"destination_folder/"`.

**3. Deleting Files:**

The `shutil` module provides the `shutil.rmtree()` function to delete directories and their contents recursively.

```python
import shutil

# Delete a directory and its contents
shutil.rmtree("directory_to_delete/")
```

In this code, we use the `shutil.rmtree()` function to delete the directory `"directory_to_delete/"` and all its contents.

The `shutil` module offers many more functions for file and directory operations, such as archiving, file permissions, and symbolic links. It provides a convenient and high-level interface for common file and directory tasks.
