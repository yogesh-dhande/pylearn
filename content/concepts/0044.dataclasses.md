Dataclasses are a convenient way to create classes that are primarily used to store data. They provide a concise syntax for automatically generating common methods, such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, based on the class attributes.

To use dataclasses, you need to import the `dataclass` decorator from the `dataclasses` module. Here's an example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    city: str

person = Person("Alice", 25, "New York")
print(person)  # Output: Person(name='Alice', age=25, city='New York')
```

In this code, we define a dataclass called `Person` using the `@dataclass` decorator. The class attributes `name`, `age`, and `city` are defined with their types as annotations.

The `@dataclass` decorator automatically generates the `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__` methods based on the class attributes. It also provides other useful features, such as automatic ordering and hashing.

When we create an instance of the `Person` dataclass and print it, the `__repr__` method is called, which provides a string representation of the object.

Dataclasses are particularly useful when you need to create simple classes for storing and manipulating data, as they reduce boilerplate code and provide useful default behavior for common methods.

Both [namedtuple](/concepts/namedtuple) and `dataclasses` are useful tools for creating lightweight classes to store data. Here are some considerations to help you decide when to use `namedtuple` or `dataclasses`:

Use `namedtuple` when:

- You need a simple data structure with named fields.
- You want a lightweight class without additional functionality or methods.
- You don't need mutability (i.e., the values of fields won't change after creation).

Use `dataclasses` when:

- You want a more feature-rich class with additional functionality.
- You need mutability and want to modify the values of fields after creation.
- You want automatic generation of common methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.
- You want to take advantage of other features provided by `dataclasses`, such as automatic ordering, hashing, and default values.

In general, if you need a simple data container with named fields and no additional functionality, `namedtuple` is a lightweight and efficient choice. On the other hand, if you require more features and flexibility, or if you anticipate the need for additional methods or customization, `dataclasses` provide a more comprehensive solution.

Consider your specific requirements and the desired functionality of your class to determine whether `namedtuple` or `dataclasses` is the better fit for your use case.
