In Python, integers and floats are two different types of numerical data.

Integers are whole numbers without any decimal points. For example:

```python
age = 15
```

In this example, `age` is a variable that holds the value `15`, which is an integer. Integers can be positive or negative.

Floats, on the other hand, are numbers that have decimal points. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14
```

In this example, `pi` is a variable that holds the value `3.14`, which is a float. Floats can also be positive or negative.

You can perform various mathematical operations on integers and floats, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 2
sum = x + y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y
```

In this code, we have two variables `x` and `y` that hold the values `5` and `2` respectively. We can add them together (`x + y`), multiply them (`x * y`), or divide them (`x / y`).

It's important to note that when you perform operations between an integer and a float, the result will be a float. For example:

```python
result = x / 2
```

In this code, `x` is an integer and `2` is an integer, but the result of the division will be a float (`2.5`).

You can also convert between integers and floats using the `int()` and `float()` functions. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = float(x)  # Convert x to a float
z = int(y)  # Convert y back to an integer
```

In this code, we convert the integer `5` to a float using `float(x)`, and then convert it back to an integer using `int(y)`.

Integers and floats are commonly used in mathematical calculations, storing measurements, and representing decimal values in Python.
