**Continue Statement**

The `continue` statement is used within loops (such as `for` or `while` loops) to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It allows you to control the flow of the loop based on certain conditions.

Let's take an example of a `for` loop with a `continue` statement:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        continue
    print(num)
```

In this code, we have a `for` loop that iterates over the `numbers` list. When the value of `num` is equal to `3`, the `continue` statement is encountered, and the remaining code in that iteration is skipped. The loop then moves to the next iteration.

The output of the code will be:

```
1
2
4
5
```

In this example, the number `3` is skipped due to the `continue` statement, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

**Break Statement**

The `break` statement is used within loops to terminate the loop prematurely. It allows you to exit the loop entirely based on certain conditions.

Let's take an example of a `while` loop with a `break` statement:

```python
count = 0

while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count == 5:
        break
```

In this code, we have a `while` loop that runs indefinitely (`while True`). Inside the loop, we print the value of `count` and increment it by `1`. When the value of `count` becomes `5`, the `break` statement is encountered, and the loop is terminated.

The output of the code will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, the loop continues until the value of `count` reaches `5`. At that point, the `break` statement is encountered, and the loop is terminated.

The `continue` and `break` statements provide control flow within loops, allowing you to skip iterations or terminate the loop based on specific conditions.
