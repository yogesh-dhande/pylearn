Context managers are a convenient way to manage resources, such as files or network connections, that need to be properly initialized and cleaned up. Context managers ensure that resources are properly handled, even if an exception occurs during the execution of a block of code.

Context managers are typically used with the `with` statement, which provides a clean and concise syntax for working with resources. Here's an example:

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this code, the `open()` function is used to open the file `"example.txt"` in read mode. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly opened and automatically closed when the block of code is finished. Inside the `with` block, we can read the content of the file and print it.

The `open()` function returns a file object, which serves as a context manager. The file object's `__enter__()` method is called when entering the `with` block, and its `__exit__()` method is called when exiting the block. The `__exit__()` method takes care of closing the file, even if an exception occurs.

Context managers can also be created using the `contextlib` module or by defining your own class with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods. Here's an example using the `contextlib` module:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context():
    # Code to initialize the resource
    print("Initializing resource...")
    yield  # Indicates the end of the setup code and the start of the with block
    # Code to clean up the resource
    print("Cleaning up resource...")

# Using the context manager
with my_context():
    print("Inside the with block")
```

In this code, the `my_context()` function is decorated with `@contextmanager` from the `contextlib` module. The function acts as a context manager by using the `yield` statement to indicate the end of the setup code and the start of the `with` block. The code inside the `yield` statement is executed when entering the `with` block, and the code after the `yield` statement is executed when exiting the block.

Context managers are useful for managing resources that need proper initialization and cleanup, such as files, database connections, or network sockets. They ensure that resources are handled correctly, even in the presence of exceptions or unexpected situations.
