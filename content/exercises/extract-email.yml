    Question:
    Write a function called `extract_email_addresses` that takes a string as input and returns a new list containing all the email addresses found in the input string. Use regular expressions (regex) to extract the email addresses.

    Example:
    Input: "Contact us at info@example.com or support@example.com for assistance."
    Output: ["info@example.com", "support@example.com"]

    import re

    def extract_email_addresses(string):
      """

      Args:

    import re

    def extract_email_addresses(string):
        # Create a regular expression to match email addresses.
        pattern = r"\S+@\S+\.\S+"
        # Find all matches for the regular expression in the text.
        matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
        # Return a list of the matches.
        return matches
