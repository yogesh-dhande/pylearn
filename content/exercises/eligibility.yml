  Question:
  Write a function called `check_voting_eligibility` that takes a person's age as input and returns a string indicating whether the person is eligible to vote or not. Use conditional statements (if-else) to perform the eligibility check.

  Consider the following criteria:
  - If the age is 18 or above, the person is eligible to vote.
  - If the age is below 18, the person is not eligible to vote.

  Example:
  Input: 20
  Output: "Eligible to vote"
