    Question:
    Write a function called `calculate_sum_of_squares` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of squares of all the elements in the list. Use a for loop with the `functools` module to perform the sum of squares calculation.

    Example:
    Input: [2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: 54
starter: |-
    import functools

    def calculate_sum_of_squares(numbers):
        """
        Calculates the sum of squares of all elements in the given list.

        Args:
            numbers (list): The input list of numbers.

        Returns:
            int: The sum of squares of all elements.
        """
        # TODO: Implement the calculate_sum_of_squares function
        pass
solution: |-
    import functools

    def calculate_sum_of_squares(numbers):
        return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y**2, numbers, 0)

    def test_calculate_sum_of_squares():
        assert calculate_sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4, 5]) == 54
        assert calculate_sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 55
        assert calculate_sum_of_squares([0, 10, 20, 30]) == 1400
        assert calculate_sum_of_squares([]) == 0
        print("All test cases pass")
