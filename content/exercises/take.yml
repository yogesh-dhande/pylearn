    Question:
    Write a function called take that takes a number `n` and a sequence `seq` as input. The function should return a list containing the first `n` elements of `seq`.

    Example:
    Input: take(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    Output: [1, 2, 3]
starter: |-
    def take(n, seq):
        """
        Returns a list containing the first n elements of seq.

        Args:
        n: The number of elements to take.
        seq: The input sequence.

        Returns:
        list: The list of the first n elements.
