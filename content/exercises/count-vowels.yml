title: Count vowels
prompt: |-
  Question:
  Write a function called count_vowels that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string and count the number of vowels. Ignore case sensitivity, meaning 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same vowel.

  Example:
  Input: "Hello, World!"
  Output: 3
