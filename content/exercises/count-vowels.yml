    Question:
    Write a function called count_vowels that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string and count the number of vowels. Ignore case sensitivity, meaning 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same vowel.

    Example:
    Input: "Hello, World!"
    Output: 3
starter: |-
    def count_vowels(string):
        """
        Counts the number of vowels in a given string.

        Args:
        string (str): The input string.

        Returns:
        int: The count of vowels in the string.
        """
        # TODO: Implement the count_vowels function
        pass

    def count_vowels(string):
        count = 0
        for char in string.lower():
            if char in 'aeiou':
                count += 1
        return count
