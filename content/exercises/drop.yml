    Question:
    Write a function called drop that takes a number `n` and a sequence `seq` as input. The function should return a list containing the elements of `seq` with the first `n` elements dropped.

    Example:
    Input: drop(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    Output: [4, 5]
starter: |-
    def drop(n, seq):
        """
        Returns a list containing the elements of seq with the first n elements dropped.

        Args:
        n: The number of elements to drop.
        seq: The input sequence.

        Returns:
        list: The list with the first n elements dropped.
