  Question:
  Write a function called `count_word_frequency` that takes a file path as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the file. The function should read the file, tokenize the words, and count their occurrences.

  Example:
  Input: "sample.txt"
  Output: {"Hello": 2, "world": 1, "Python": 3}

starter: |-
  def count_word_frequency(file_path):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each word in a file.

    Args:
      file_path (str): The path to the input file.

    Returns:
      dict: A dictionary containing the word frequency.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the count_word_frequency function
    pass

          for line in file:

              for word in words:
                  word_frequency[word] = word_frequency.get(word, 0) + 1
      return word_frequency

    word_frequency = count_word_frequency(file_path)
    assert word_frequency == {"Hello": 2, "world!": 1, "Python": 3}
