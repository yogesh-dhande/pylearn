starter: |
  # Fix the error in the code below
  print(hello)  # output: hello
solution: |
  # Fix: strings are defined using quotes; otherwise python looks for a variable named `hello` 
  # and fails to find one
  print("hello")
  
tests: |
  # There are no tests for this code as it is just a syntax fix
